      <p>Professor Adi Shamir was born in Israel in 1952, and received his Ph.D. from the Weizmann Institute of Science in 1977. Between 1977 and 1980 he was a faculty member at MIT, and then returned to Israel, where he is currently a professor in the Applied Mathematics Department of the Weizmann Institute of Science.

Professor Shamir is well known for his contributions to cryptography. In 1977 he invented, with Rivest and Adleman, the first practical public key cryptosystem, and in 1982 he cracked the knapsack cryptosystem developed by Merkle and Hellman from Stanford University.<br><br>Quotes from Adi Shamir: “Fully secure systems don't exist today and they won't exist in the future.”
